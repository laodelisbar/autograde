## About Autograde

Autograde is an online test app where you can answer essay, or fillable question and get your grade in realtime, without waiting for your educators to grade them manually. The current problem with online testing platforms is that essay responses often need to match answer keys exactly, and automated scoring doesnâ€™t exist for subjective responses. This results in delayed feedback for students and fails to account for varied, yet valid, expressions of understanding. Our solution addresses a core pain point in online assessments, enabling students and educators to focus more on learning and less on administrative delays.
